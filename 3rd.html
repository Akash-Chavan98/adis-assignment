            console.log(1 +  "2" + "2");//output: 122   logic: 1 is considered as number, "2" is considered as string, "2" is also considered as string hence we concatinate all values.

            console.log(1 +  +"2" + "2");// output: 32  logic: 1 is considered as number, +"2" is also considered as number hence we add 1+2=3, "2" is considered as string  hence we concat it to added ans.

            console.log(1 +  -"1" + "2");//output:02    logic: 1 and -"1" are considered as numbers hence we subtract it because of - sign ans=0 ,"2" is considered as string hence we concat it to ans.

            console.log(+"1" +  "1" + "2");//output:112  logic: +"1" is considered as number, "1" and "2" are considered as strings hence we concat all values

            console.log( "A" - "B" + "2");//output:NaN2  logic: "A" and "B" are alphabets hence we get 'Not A Number(NaN)', 2 is concatinated as string

            console.log( "A" - "B" + 2);//output:NaN     logic: "A" and "B" are alphabets hence we get 'Not A Number(NaN)', 2 is number but we cannot add to alphabets.
